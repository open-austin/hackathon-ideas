# Google Community Connections Dataset and Visualization Tool

*If you want to support this proposal, add your feedback [here](https://github.com/open-austin/hackathon-ideas/issues/10).*


### Who will benefit the most from this project?

Academic and administrative researchers interested in commonalities among successful applications to the Community Connections program. What similarities are there among beneficiaries? What tacit connections may there be among beneficiary organizations?

Non-profit organizations and community groups that wish to leverage Google Community Connections broadband services. Organizations in future cities may be able to see 


### What is the problem you are trying to solve by participating in the hackathon?

The Google Community Connections program provides free Google Fiber
connections to 100 non-profit organizations designated by the City. The
selections have been announced, and have been published by the city.

The recipient organizations submitted an application for the connection.
Their application described what they would do if granted the connection.
Those applications have been scanned and posted in raster format by the city. As they exist on the city's open data portal, they are not machine-readable or searchable.

We wish to have a way to search and visualize the applications, to identify
programs of interest, and opportunities for novel/cooperative ventures.


### What evidence (anecdotal or otherwise) do you have that this is a need?

There has been significant interest in the Google Community Connections
program, and quite a bit of work has been done with just the list of
recipient sites.

One of our volunteers produced a map that has gathered a lot of interest.

Austin Business Journal did an article with its own visualizations of the
data.

This project would provide even richer data to feed an interest that's
already been demonstrated.


### What resources will you be providing to support the development team?

A first pass OCR (optical character recognition) has been performed on
the applications.  This converts the scanned documents to text.

Our primary challenge is non-programming -- review the OCR results and
correct any errors.

This project will convert the scanned applications to plain text files that may be published on the city data portal.

One media-studies doctoral student has been using the native OCR feature in Adobe Acrobat Pro. He plans to use the R(tm) for text-mining the applications. 


### List current solutions and why you need a new approach to be developed:

The applications are public information, already available for viewing, but are not in a searchable
or machine consumable form. This project will also serve as a pilot for future projects that involve liberating public documents that are not currently in machine-readable form. Developing a workflow for validating and publishing OCRed text may have application for future projects.


### At the end of the weekend, what does success look like? What are your expected outcomes?

A dataset that contains structured information on the 100 selected Google Community Connections
applications. A tools that allows searching and visualization of the data.
