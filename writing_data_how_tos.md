Creating How-To Content for Citizen Data Analysts

Submitted by: Juliette Kernion (https://github.com/kernion)

### Who will benefit the most from this project?

Austinites who want to access and use open data directly from the City of Austin Data Portal. 

### What is the problem you are trying to solve by participating in the hackathon?

I'd like to help people learn to find, view and manipulate data in the Data Portal. I'd also like to explain _why_ this is useful. Right now the only available help is via videos, which don’t show the big picture or structure tasks in linear order.


### What evidence (anecdotal or otherwise) do you have that this is a need?

As a tech writer, I'm accustomed to learning new applications quickly on my own, but I found the Data Portal difficult. For example, it took me awhile to figure out that I can find/view/use other people's saved views. 

### What resources will you be providing to support the development team?

In this case, the development team will be primarily writers, ideally with technical writing/procedural writing experience. Tools TBD but will need some way to manage content and to take screenshots. We're reaching out to people who maintain the portal to get support resources for this project.

### List current solutions and why you need a new approach to be developed:

The current solutions on the Data Portal site are videos. A significant number of people don't like to watch videos to learn. The videos are not the most efficient way to learn, and they don't walk you through the Data Portal in any kind of linear sequence. We need more integrated procedures as well as addressing why users would find specific functionality to be useful.


### At the end of the weekend, what does success look like? What are your expected outcomes?

Our expected outcome is a solid draft of content that helps people use the Data Portal. This might be a CMS hosted on a public website, or raw content that the City can import onto their site, or Google Docs that can be shared. The content itself is the main goal.
