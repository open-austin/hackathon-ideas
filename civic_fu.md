# Civic FU
 
Submitted by: [Chip Rosenthal](https://github.com/chip-rosenthal)


### Who will benefit the most from this project?

Very broad, local community.


### What is the problem you are trying to solve by participating in the hackathon?

The "FU" stands for "Finish Up."

Previous hackathons have resulted in a number of prototypes for
significant, very useful civic projects. Unfortunately, due to some
unsolved design and technical issues, they have not moved out of a
prototype stage.

The goal of this project is to spend a concerted weekend solving
the remaining challenges, and bring these projects to a deployable,
production status.


### What evidence (anecdotal or otherwise) do you have that this is a need?

We continue to see interest in these projects, but are still waiting on
final deployment.


### What resources will you be providing to support the development team?

The projects are:

ATX Scores - A restaurant inspection score search app.
Vote ATX - A voting place finder app.
Austin Recycles - An app that answers "When do we put our carts out?"

A doc will be posted that includes links to the prototype apps, source
code, and specific issues to be resolved.


### List current solutions and why you need a new approach to be developed:

These apps have been selected because they are all novel and unique, and
have been demonstrated to provide value and garner interest.


### At the end of the weekend, what does success look like? What are your expected outcomes?

All three applications ready to be deployed, at a permanent URL.
