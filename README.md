# Hackathon Ideas

This repository contains community-curated civic project ideas for [ATX Hack for Change 2014](http://atxhackforchange.org/).

The goal of this project is to:

1. Identify and refine civic project ideas.
1. Solicit community support and identify a _champion_ to bring the project to the event.


## How to contribute an idea.

If you have a _github_ account, then:

1. Clone this repository.
1. Copy the TEMPLATE.md file to a new file, called something like "Project_Name.md".
1. Change the title at the top of the page to the project name.
1. Fill out the questionnaire.

If you do not have (and do not want) a _github_ account then you could just [download the template](http:TEMPLATE.md), fill it out with a text editor, and [send it via email](mailto:hack@open-austin.org).

Stuff to know:
* The file is formatted in _Markdown_ style. Help [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
* Helpful information about hackathon project ideas [here](http://atxhackforchange.org/projects/).
* The careful observer may note that the template is based on the project submission form for the hackathon.

## How to provide feedback for an idea.

You will need a _github_ account to participate in the discussion.

Use the _github_ "Issues" feature to discuss an idea. Click "Issues" in the sidebar, check whether there already is an issue opened for the project and discussion point you wish to make.

If not, click "Create a new issue", and submit your feedback.

## How to support an idea.

You will need a _github_ account to express your support.

In this context, support means you're potentially interested in working on this project at the hackathon.

Use the _github_ "Issues" feature to express your support for an idea. Click "Issues" in the sidebar, and check whether there is an issue alrady open to express your support for the project. If so, add your comment of support. If not, "create a new issue" and indicate your support for the project.
